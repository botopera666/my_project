    <p><i>Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida</i> (Spanish: [xoaˈkin soˈɾoʎa]; 27 February 1863 – 10 August 1923) 
        was a Spanish painter. <br>
        Sorolla excelled in the painting of portraits, 
        landscapes and monumental works of social and historical themes.<br> 
        His most typical works are characterized by a dexterous representation of the people 
        and landscape under the bright sunlight of Spain and sunlit water.</p>

        <li><h3>Early life</h3></li>
        <img src="Joaquin Sorolla2.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Joaquín Sorolla was born on 27 February 1863 in Valencia, Spain. <br>
            Sorolla was the eldest child born to a tradesman, also named Joaquin Sorolla, and his wife, Concepción Bastida. <br>
            His sister, Concha, was born a year later. <br>
            In August 1865, both children were orphaned when their parents died, possibly from cholera. <br>
            They were thereafter cared for by their maternal aunt and uncle, a locksmith.<br>
    
    
            The death of Pedro Velarde y Santillán during the defence of the Monteleon Artillery Barracks, 1884.<br>
            He received his initial art education at the age of 9 in his native town, <br>
            and then under a succession of teachers including Cayetano Capuz, Salustiano Asenjo. <br>
            At the age of eighteen he traveled to Madrid, vigorously studying master paintings in the Museo del Prado. <br>
            After completing his military service, Sorolla, at age twenty-two, obtained a grant which enabled a four-year term to study painting in Rome, Italy, <br>
            where he was welcomed by and found stability in the example of Francisco Pradilla, the director of the Spanish Academy in Rome. <br>
            A long sojourn to Paris in 1885 provided his first exposure to modern painting; <br>
            of special influence were exhibitions of Jules Bastien-Lepage and Adolf von Menzel. <br>
            Back in Rome he studied with José Benlliure, Emilio Sala, and José Villegas Cordero.<br>
            
            In 1888, Sorolla returned to Valencia to marry Clotilde García del Castillo, whom he had first met in 1879, while working in her father's studio. <br>
            By 1895, they would have three children together: Maria, born in 1890, Joaquín, born in 1892, and Elena, born in 1895. <br>
            In 1890, they moved to Madrid, and for the next decade Sorolla's efforts as an artist were <br>
            focussed mainly on the production of large canvases of orientalist, mythological, historical, and social subjects, <br>
            for display in salons and international exhibitions in Madrid, Paris, Venice, Munich, Berlin, and Chicago.<br>
            
            His first striking success was achieved with Another Marguerite (1892), <br>
            which was awarded a gold medal at the National Exhibition in Madrid, then first prize at the Chicago International Exhibition, <br>
            where it was acquired and subsequently donated to the Washington University Museum in St. Louis, Missouri. <br>
            He soon rose to general fame and became the acknowledged head of the modern Spanish school of painting. <br>
            His picture The Return from Fishing (1894) was much admired at the Paris Salon and was acquired by the state for the Musée du Luxembourg. <br>
            It indicated the direction of his mature output.<br>
            
            Sorolla painted two masterpieces in 1897 linking art and science: Portrait of Dr. Simarro at the microscope and A Research. <br>
            These paintings were presented at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts held in Madrid in that year and Sorolla won the Prize of Honor. <br>
            Here, he presents his friend Simarro as a man of science who transmits his wisdom investigating and, <br>
            in addition, it is the triumph of naturalism, as it recreates the indoor environment of the laboratory, catching the luminous atmosphere <br>
            produced by the artificial reddish-yellow light of a gas burner that contrasts with the weak mauvish afternoon light that shines through the window. <br>
            These paintings may be among the most outstanding world paintings of this genre.</p>
            <br>
    
        <li><h3>Sad Inheritance</h3></li>
        <img src="Joaquin Sorolla3.jpg" width="500">
        <p>An even greater turning point in Sorolla's career was marked by the painting and exhibition of Sad Inheritance (1899, seen at right), <br>
            an extremely large canvas, highly finished for public consideration. <br>
            The subject was a depiction of crippled children bathing at the sea in Valencia, under the supervision of a monk. <br>
            They are the victims of hereditary syphilis the title implies, perhaps. <br>
            Campos has suggested that the polio epidemic that struck the land of Valencia some years earlier is present, <br>
            possibly for the first time in the history of painting, through the image of two affected children. <br>
            The painting earned Sorolla his greatest official recognition, the Grand Prix and a medal of honor at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900, <br>
            and the medal of honor at the National Exhibition in Madrid in 1901.
    
            A series of preparatory oil sketches for Sad Inheritance were painted with the greatest luminosity and bravura, <br>
            and foretold an increasing interest in shimmering light and of a medium deftly handled. <br>
            Sorolla thought well enough of these sketches that he presented two of them as gifts to American artists; <br>
            one to John Singer Sargent, the other to William Merritt Chase. <br>
            After this painting Sorolla never returned to a theme of such overt social consciousness.</p>
        <br>
    
        <li><h3>Maturity</h3></li>
        <img src="Joaquin Sorolla4.jpg" width="500">
        <p>The exhibit at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 won him a medal of honour and his nomination as Knight of the Legion of Honour; <br>
            within the next few years Sorolla was honoured as a member of the Fine Art Academies of Paris, Lisbon, and Valencia, and as a Favourite Son of Valencia.<br>
    
            A special exhibition of his works—figure subjects, landscapes and portraits—at the Galeries Georges Petit in Paris in 1906 <br>
            eclipsed all his earlier successes and led to his appointment as Officer of the Legion of Honour. <br>
            The show included nearly 500 works, early paintings as well as recent sun-drenched beach scenes, <br>
            landscapes, and portraits, a productivity which amazed critics and was a financial triumph. <br>
            Though subsequent large-scale exhibitions in Germany and London were greeted with more restraint, <br>
            while in England in 1908 Sorolla met Archer Milton Huntington, who made him a member of The Hispanic Society of America in New York City, <br>
            and invited him to exhibit there in 1909. The exhibition comprised 356 paintings, 195 of which sold. <br>
            Sorolla spent five months in America and painted more than twenty portraits.<br>
            
            Sorolla's work is often exhibited together with that of his contemporaries and friends, John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn.</p>
        <br>
    
        <li><h3>Portraits</h3></li>
        <img src="Joaquin Sorolla5.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Although formal portraiture was not Sorolla's genre of preference, because it tended to restrict his creative appetites and could reflect his lack of interest in his subjects, <br>
            the acceptance of portrait commissions proved profitable, and the portrayal of his family was irresistible. <br>
            Sometimes the influence of Velázquez was uppermost, as in My Family (1901), a reference to Las Meninas which grouped his wife and children in the foreground, <br>
            the painter reflected, at work, in a distant mirror.<br>
            At other times the desire to compete with his friend John Singer Sargent was evident, as in Portrait of Mrs. <br>
            Ira Nelson Morris and her children (1911).[18] A series of portraits produced in the United States in 1909, <br>
            commissioned through the Hispanic Society of America, was capped by the Portrait of Mr. Taft, President of the United States, <br>
            This portrait, which was painted at the White House, is on permanent display at the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
            
            The appearance of sunlight could be counted on to rouse his interest, and it was outdoors where he found his ideal portrait settings. <BR>
            Thus, not only did his daughter pose standing in a sun-dappled landscape for María at La Granja (1907), <br>
            but so did Spanish royalty, for the Portrait of King Alfonso XIII in a Hussar's Uniform (1907). <br>
            For Portrait of Mr. Louis Comfort Tiffany (1911), the American artist posed seated at his easel in his Long Island garden, surrounded by extravagant flowers. <br>
            The conceit reaches its high point in My Wife and Daughters in the Garden (1910, see gallery below), <br>
            in which the idea of traditional portraiture gives way to the sheer fluid delight of a painting constructed with thick passages of color, <br>
            Sorolla's love of family and sunlight merged.
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <li><h3>The Provinces of Spain</h3></li>
        <img src="Joaquin Sorolla6.jpeg" height="500">
        <p>Early in 1911, Sorolla visited the United States for a second time, and exhibited 152 new paintings at the Saint Louis Art Museum and <br>
            161 at the Art Institute of Chicago a few weeks later. <br>
            Later that year Sorolla met Archie Huntington in Paris and signed a contract to paint a series of oils on life in Spain. <br>
            These 14 magnificent murals, installed to this day in the Hispanic Society of America building in Manhattan, <br>
            range from 12 to 14 feet in height, and total 227 feet in length. <br>
            The major commission of his career, it would dominate the later years of Sorolla's life.<br>
    
            Huntington had envisioned the work depicting a history of Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific Vision of Spain, <br>
            eventually opting for a representation of the regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. <br>
            Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: <br>
            Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, <br>
            at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, <br>
            panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. <br>
            He completed the final panel by July 1919.<br>
            
            Sorolla suffered a stroke in 1920, while painting a portrait in his garden in Madrid. <br>
            Paralysed for over three years, he died on 10 August 1923. <br>
            He is buried in the Cementeri de Valencia, Spain.<br>
            
            The Sorolla Room, housing the Provinces of Spain at the Hispanic Society of America, opened to the public in 1926. <br>
            The room closed for remodeling in 2008, and the murals toured museums in Spain for the first time. <br>
            The Sorolla Room reopened in 2010, with the murals on permanent display.</p>
